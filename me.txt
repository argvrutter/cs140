Why did I choose to Study computer science?
    I have been involved with website and server administration and creation since middle school. Originally, I developed computer skills to play games such as Minecraft with friends, and made an effort to expand that to a broader gaming community by providing a website and game server hosting. See robosane.net. Taking AP computer science was a wonderful experience & I felt like I was naturally talented. I love this sort of problem solving.
